Usage/Tips/Bugs
------------
If you close all the windows type "/ck", "/customkeystones" "/customkeys" to bring up either the active key or the main menu.

Closing an active key menu is cheating currently as time stops when you close the window.
	-Obviously I'm not the police and can't moderate this, but it's for fun so idk why you would cheat. (Will be bugfixed soon)
	
Pet kills currently DO NOT count towards % or bosses, working on a fix.
